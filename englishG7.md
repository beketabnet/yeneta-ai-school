While-reading
Read the following passage to do activities 3.13 and 3.14.
Globally, there are about 1.2 million deaths and up to 50 million nonfatal injuries due to road traffic crash. It is a great problem especially for low and middle income countries in which 90% of the victims were found. The problem may grow further in the coming decades due to the rapid rise of vehicles. Studies have shown that a well-designed road safety policy contributed a lion share for the declining in the number and severity of road crashes.

According to the European Transport Safety Council estimation, if all existing road safety laws in European Union are enforced, up to 50% of death and injuries could be prevented. Similarly, in re- cent years, many low income countries are implementing improved road safety policy that include exceeding the speed limit, impaired driving by alcohol and drugs, phoning and texting while driv-
 

ing, and not using seat belt. However, the effectiveness in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities is minimal. For example, Brazil, after implementing an improved traffic code with stiff penalty and media coverage, a 21% and 25% reduction of injuries and fatalities was observed, respectively.

There is an improved road safety policy in Ethiopia which was enforced in 2007. This improved road safety policy includes: prohibition of cell phone conversation while driving, driving without using a seat belt and not using motorcycle helmet; the amendment of the existing road safety laws such as excessive speeding, driving with alcohol and chat and unsafe loading and introducing higher penalty rate which is suspension of drivers’ license.
(Slightly adapted from: Effectiveness of an improved road safety policy in Ethiopia, Teferi et al. 2014)
Activity 3.13: Write true or false according to the information in the passage.

1.	Road traffic crash is a more serious problem in high income countries than in low income coun tries.
2.	The application of road safety policy plays a major role in reducing accidents.
3.	Recently, many developing countries have started to implement road safety policy to limit the speed and use of alcohol and drugs.
4.	There is no road safety policy in Ethiopia.
5.	Wearing seat belt and helmet and not making phone calls while driving are necessary precau tions to reduce traffic accidents.
Activity 3.14: Give short answers to the questions below based on the information in the passage.
1.	After the implementation of road safety policy in Brazil, by what percentage did injuries and
fatalities rate decrease?
2.	What things are prohibited in Ethiopia as a result of the improved road safety policy?

2.	crossing the street when you are a blind person is a real challenge on a daily basis. among the many existing solutions, accessible pedestrian signals (aps) represent the best option to secure and facilitate the crossing for visually-impaired and blind people. an aps is an integrated device that sends an audio signal to indicate to pedestrians if they can cross the road safely. this device allows blind pedestrians to cross the road at the right time, more quickly and safely while maintaining their orientation throughout the crossing. accessible began to emerge in the 1970s in the united states and have since largely evolved to adapt to their environment and their users. aps are known by different names around the world such as: acoustic signals, audio-tactile signals, audible pedes- trian signals, audible traffic signals, audible pedestrian traffic signals or audible crossing indicators from a legal point of view, the aps must comply with local laws of each country.
